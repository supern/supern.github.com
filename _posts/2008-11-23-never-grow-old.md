这首歌还挺好听的，小子我今晚就听着这首歌写下了“统计之都”的[关于页面](http://cos.name/about/)。顺便发布一下通知，统计之都自今日起全面转型（访问[新的统计之都网站](http://cos.name)），我在两年多前的“博客+论坛”结构终于出现在人世间了，另外还加上了维基。从现在起，要真正开始广邀天下统计英雄共同建设这座都城了。


> I had a dream
Strange it may seems
It was my perfect day

Open my eyes
I realize
This is my perfect day

Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old

Do-do-do-do

Birds in the sky
They look so high
This is my perfect day

I feel the breeze
I feel it is
It is my perfect day

Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old

Forever young
I hope you stay
Forever young
Do-do-do-do
